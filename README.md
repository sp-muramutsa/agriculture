## üìñ Project Overview

This project applies **Machine Learning**, specifically **multi-class classification**, to predict the most suitable crop for a field based on soil metrics, helping farmers make informed decisions that maximize yield.

Assessing soil condition through essential metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value is a key part of agricultural planning. Each crop has an ideal combination of soil nutrients that supports optimal growth.
Given the high cost of measuring soil nutrients, our model assists in:

* Reducing soil testing overhead
* Prioritizing key features influencing crop success
* Improving farming productivity using interpretable AI

We explore advanced explainability techniques (SHAP) to uncover which soil metrics most influence crop selection.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

* **File:** `soil_measures.csv`
* **Rows:** 2,200+ observations
* **Features:**

  * `N`, `P`, `K` ‚Äî Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium levels
  * `pH` ‚Äî Soil acidity/alkalinity
  * `crop` ‚Äî Target label: the optimal crop for given soil metrics(22 different crops)

Each row corresponds to a unique soil profile, with the crop being the recommended planting choice under those conditions.

---

## üîß Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

* **Label encoding** of categorical crop labels for classification.
* **Standardization** of numerical soil features using `StandardScaler`.
* **Train-test split** with stratification to ensure balanced class representation.
* **Manual feature ablation** to assess individual predictive contributions of `N`, `P`, `K`, and `pH`.

## üìä Feature Importance

| Feature | Avg. Coefficient Weight | F1 Score (solo) | SHAP Insights               |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| K       | High                    | Highest         | Strong positive contributor |
| N       | Moderate                | Second-best     | Influential for many crops  |
| P       | Moderate                | Mixed           | Paired with others (pH)     |
| pH      | Low                     | Weak            | Influential only in context |

## üîç Model Interpretability (SHAP)

We utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze feature contributions both at:

* **Individual level** (waterfall plots for sample predictions)
* **Class level** (summary plots for each crop)
* **Global level** (bar chart aggregating across all crops)

This helped identify **interaction effects** between soil features that impact the model's crop recommendation decisions.

---

## üéØ Final Results

* Logistic Regression achieved solid performance with interpretable weights.
* SHAP revealed:

  * `K` and `N` are consistently influential.
  * Some crops are sensitive to combinations (e.g., `P + pH`).
* pH has low linear influence but interacts with others non-linearly.
